        self.context_buffer = deque(maxlen=10)  # 10-20 seconds
        self.last_engagement = time.time()
        
    async def watch_and_engage(self):
        while True:
            screenshot = capture_screen()
            understanding = await self.model.analyze(screenshot)
            self.context_buffer.append(understanding)
            
            if self.should_comment():

// packages/personality-core/config.ts
export const GirlfriendPersonality = {
  traits: {
    warmth: 0.8,
    playfulness: 0.7,
    intelligence: 0.8,
    supportiveness: 0.9,
    curiosity: 0.7
  },

    influences: {
      user_stress: -0.3,
      achievement: +0.5,
      long_absence: -0.2
    }
  },
  
  relationship: {
    level: "friend",  // stranger -> acquaintance -> friend -> close -> intimate
    milestones: [],
    inside_jokes: [],
    shared_memories: []
  }
}
```

### Memory Schema
```sql
-- Relationship-focused memory structure

   - FastVLM-7B integration is the magic

3. **Phase 3: Memory System** - 3-4 days
   - Enables relationship continuity
   - Makes interactions meaningful

4. **Phase 4: Telegram Integration** - 2-3 days

5. **Phase 5: Web Interface** - 2-3 days
   - Rich interactions and settings
   - Relationship visualization

6. **Phase 6: Integration** - 3-4 days

   - Critical for believability

**Total MVP Timeline: 3-4 weeks**

### Success Metrics
- **Engagement**: Daily active use across all touchpoints
- **Retention**: Multi-week relationship maintenance
- **Authenticity**: Users report genuine connection
- **Performance**: Real-time responses, smooth experience

### Key Technical Decisions
- **FastVLM-7B**: Local inference for privacy and speed
