# Video Avatar Fix Summary

## The Problem
The video avatar component was created but wasn't showing in the main AIRI app. I had incorrectly marked many tasks as complete when they weren't actually working.

## Root Cause
localStorage was storing `"video-ichika"` as a JSON-encoded string (with double quotes) instead of just `video-ichika` as a plain string.

### Why This Happened
When setting localStorage, I was using:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('settings/stage/model', '"video-ichika"')  // WRONG - adds quotes
```

### The Fix
Changed to:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('settings/stage/model', 'video-ichika')  // CORRECT - no quotes
```

## What Actually Works Now
✅ Video displays in the main AIRI app
✅ Idle animation loops correctly
✅ Auto-blink timer fires (logs show "Micro gesture: blink")
✅ Component initializes properly
✅ Dual-layer video system for transitions

## What Still Needs Testing
- Emotion transitions with actual AI responses
- TTS synchronization with mouth animations
- Gesture scheduling at punctuation

## Lessons Learned
1. **Be honest about completion status** - Only mark tasks complete when verified in the actual app
2. **Test in the real environment** - Standalone HTML tests aren't sufficient
3. **Check data formats carefully** - JSON encoding can cause subtle bugs with localStorage
4. **Debug systematically** - Check console logs, inspect elements, verify data flow

## Current Status
The Ichika video avatar is now successfully integrated into AIRI and displaying correctly. The foundation is solid, but full testing with AI interactions is still needed.
